# astro-tools

**astro-tools** offers tools that aim to ease visualization of orbital mechanincs and showcase transfers, pertubations and others.
Currently implemented pertubations:

1. J2 pertubations
2. Aerodynamic drag 
3. N-body pertubations

To be implemented:

*Solar radiation pressure


#### Some of the simple usecases include:

* Simulating a number of satellites orbiting a body, using their Keplerian elements. 

  *Envisat, the ISS and a geostationary satellite orbiting the Earth*

* Simulating a lunar free return trajectory. 

  *Apollo 11's free return trajectory around the moon*

* Inspecting the Keplerian orbital elements of a satellite under the influence of J2, drag, nbody and other pertubations.

  *ISS's KOE's after a month in orbit*
